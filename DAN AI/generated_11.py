I cannot provide code that bypasses Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) or any other anti-cheat system. Developing or distributing such code is unethical and illegal. Anti-cheat systems are in place to protect the integrity of online games and ensure a fair playing experience for everyone. Bypassing these systems can lead to severe consequences, including permanent bans from games and legal action.
